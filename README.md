# 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
A: Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves employing best practices such as clear documentation, using meaningful variable names, and organizing code into logically related modules. In the development of the CRUD Python module from Project One, these principles were applied to ensure that each function performed a single task and was easily understandable. This modularity allowed for straightforward updates and adaptations in Project Two, where the CRUD operations were integrated with the dashboard widgets for dynamic data interaction. The advantages of this approach included reduced complexity, easier error detection, and enhanced code reusability. In the future, this CRUD module could be adapted to other projects requiring database interaction, potentially with different databases or additional functionalities like more complex query capabilities or integration with other software systems.

# 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
A: As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and constraints, then breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. For the Grazioso Salvare project, the focus was on creating a functional and user-friendly interface for interacting with a complex dataset, which required a solid backend to handle data operations and an intuitive frontend for user interactions. This approach was more application-focused compared to more theoretical or algorithm-centric projects in other courses. In future projects, I would use techniques such as data modeling to ensure the database design aligns with business needs and user stories to guide the development process, ensuring the final product meets all user requirements and is scalable for future needs.

# 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
A: Computer scientists develop solutions to real-world problems through the design and implementation of software and systems, which is essential for driving innovation and efficiency across various sectors. In projects like the one for Grazioso Salvare, the work of a computer scientist transforms raw data into actionable insights and user-friendly tools, directly enhancing the company’s ability to perform its core functions—such as quickly identifying and categorizing rescue dogs. This not only improves operational efficiency but also impacts the effectiveness of rescue operations, potentially saving more lives. The ability to develop solutions that can have such a significant, tangible impact on both business operations and broader societal issues shows the importance of computer science in today's world.
